# Setting #

The setting is within the Noosphere, a place created and maintained by humanity's collective
thoughts, emotions and dreams. Recently, a number of young girls have started to be pulled
into the Noosphere whenever they fall asleep, with each trip occuring as a single shared 
lucid dream; this may have been the end of it, if it were not for the fact that these girls
could communicate from different parts of the planet perfectly. These girls call themselves
'Visionaries'.

Since a Visionary is a lucid dreamer, they can affect the world around them more or less
freely; however, the way they affect the Noosphere is specific, and varies between them. They
do share a pattern though - to perform actions remotely, they all require agents. These agents
are referred to as Catalysts (for stationary 'buildings') and Adjuvants (for mobile 'units').
